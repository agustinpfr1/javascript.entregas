        <h1>Rent or Buy Calculator</h1>
        <h2>Is It Better to Rent or Buy?</h2>
        <p>The choice between buying a home and renting one is among the biggest financial decisions that many adults
            make.
            But the costs of buying are more varied and complicated than for renting, making it hard to tell which is a
            better deal.
            To help you answer this question, our calculator takes the most important costs associated with buying a
            house and computes the equivalent monthly rent.</p>

        <h3>Home price</h3>
        <p>A very important factor, but not the only one. Our estimate will improve as you enter more details below.</p>

        <h3>How Long Do You Plan to Stay?</h3>
        <p>Buying tends to be better the longer you stay because the upfront fees are spread out over many years.
        </p>
        <div class="slidecontainer">
            <input type="range" min="1" max="40" value="1" class="slider" id="myRange">

        <h3>What are your mortgage details?</h3>
        <p>In addition to the interest rate and down payment, the calculator takes into account the mortgage-interest
            tax deduction.

        <h3>What Does the Future Hold?</h3>
        <p>How much home prices, rents and stock prices change can have a large impact on your outcome.
            Unfortunately, these are some of the hardest things to predict.
            If you choose to rent instead of buying, the calculator assumes that you’ll spend your would-be down payment
            on stocks or another investment.

        <h3>Taxes</h3>
        <p>Property taxes and mortgage-interest costs are significant but also deductible.
            The higher your marginal tax rate is, the bigger the deduction.

        <h3>Additional Renting Costs
        </h3>
        <p>These are the costs on top of rent, such as the fee you pay to a broker and the opportunity cost on your security deposit. 
        But these expenses typically have a negligible impact.
